# Chess Online

Have you ever wanted to play chess but don't have all the pieces? I plan to make a web application so you can play chess online without having to own a board and pieces. You will be able to play with your friends online so that even if you aren't together, you can still enjoy this great game.

Simon HTML Assignment:
- Organize file with Head and Body tags, organize Body section into a Header, Main, and Footer.
- Leave comments where I'm going to need to add features later.

Simon CSS Assignment:
- Need to look more into the main, basic bootstrap classes becuase it seems to be way easier to use them than creating my own from scratch.
- Using bootstrap css classes as a foundation and then overriding them to customize further seems to be effective.

Simon JS Assignment:
- Need to figure out way to model functionality using JavaScript for chess, seems like it'll be a lot more complicated than using css and javascript like in the Simon example.
- Use id's and classes to specify exactly what to select for different functions.
